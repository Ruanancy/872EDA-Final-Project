# 872EDA-Final-Project

## Summary

This repository explores what listed firms with great ESG performance look like for the purpose of finishing the final report of Spring 2022 ENV872 Environmental Data Analysis (EDA) Course at Duke University. This final report is finished by Min Ruan and Suad Muradov. We identified the research question, retrieved and wrangled the data, do the visualization and run multiple regressions to answer two questions:

* Are ESG scores from different rating agencies consistent without significant divergences?
* How can these ownership structure factors (ownership concentration, blockholders' ownership, independent board ratio, chairman duality) affect ESG performance?
